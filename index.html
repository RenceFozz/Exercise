<b>David Tennant</b> played the highly famous Tenth Doctor from the BBC TV series, Doctor Who, which has been running from 1963 up until the present time. He played the role from 2005-2010, and was replaced by <b>Matt Smith</b> (Eleventh Doctor).
<br><br>
In the show, the main character, as obvious from the title, is Doctor Who a.k.a. the Doctor, a time traveling alien known as a Time Lord from the planet, Gallifrey, which was lost inside a pocket dimension after the Last Great Time War, in which the Doctor played a huge part of, consequently making him one of the last of his own kind. He was never alone though. Along the way, he has had many companions to keep him company during his travels. Plus in the show, he was mostly referred to as just "the Doctor" or "Doctor" because his true name has never been revealed and has only been known to very few people in the show.
<br><br>
Now another theme of the show was the theme of regeneration. The Time Lords, if ever their bodies have grown too damaged or old, could regenerate their body into another form meaning this Doctor is still technically the same character that was shown when the show first aired in 1963 but is just in a different skin. It has been shown in the show that the Time Lords can only regenerate 12 times meaning that there could only be 13 incarnations of a Time Lord in his or her liftime. The Doctor, however, became an exception to this rule in the 2013 episode and Christmas special, "Time of the Doctor" where he was given a new set of regenerations.
<br><br>
A time-traveller also wouldn't be a time-traveller if he didn't have a means of traveling. In the show, the Doctor uses the T.A.R.D.I.S. or the Time and Relative Dimension In Space, which has taken the form of a 1960's police box. Although the series has stated that the TARDIS can change its form because of the chameleon ciruit technology installed in it, the Doctor has decided to keep it in its original form either because the circuit was damaged or may have been out of sentimental value.
<br><br>
The Doctor has also made many enemies along the way. His most famous adversaries were the Daleks (an alien race mutated and made into cyborgs), the Cybermen (humans turned into cyborgs but with an emotional inhibitor) and the Master (a rival Time Lord). The Daleks were ancient enemies of the Time Lords. They sought out the destruction of any species or alien race that wasn't a Dalek such as themselves. The Cybermen, on the other hand, sought out humans to help their Cyber-armies grow and conquer. The Master was another Time Lord that has escaped the Last Great Time War but even before then, has had a bitter rivalry with the Doctor. The Doctor and the Master were originally friends in their childhood but after a Time Lord initiation (staring into the Time Vortex) became unstable.
